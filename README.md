# Titanic Survival Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and builds a basic
machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
- File: data/titanic.csv
- Rows: 418
- Target Variable: Survived

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Handle missing values
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Encode categorical features
5. Train Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluate model performance

## 📈 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate
- Passenger class significantly influenced survival

## 🚧 Project Status
✅ Completed (Beginner Machine Learning Project)

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add more features (Age, Fare, Family size)
